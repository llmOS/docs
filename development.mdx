OpenCopilot is built modularly so you can customize it further based on your own needs easily.

## 1. Backend

Create `backend/.env` if it has not been created through `python cli.py create`:

```shell
cd backend
cp template.env .env
```

Spin up Weaviate for vector storage:

```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose-weaviate.yml up -d
```

Setup conda environment
```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate backend-service
```

Ingest data - ***You will need to repeat this step each time you add new data in the data folder***

***Optional***: To improve document loading experience, use
[libmagic1](https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic#installation) and
[tesseract](https://github.com/madmaze/pytesseract#installation) libraries

```shell
python ingest_data.py
```

Run backend REST AP:

```shell
python wsgi.py
```

After some time you should see
```
..........
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

## 2. Frontend

Create `frontend/.env` if it has not been created through `python cli.py create`:

```shell
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env
```

Install dependencies
```
pnpm install
```

Run frontend app:
```
pnpm run dev
```

You are now ready to change any part of the copilot!

**You need to restart the docker services to deploy the changes.**
