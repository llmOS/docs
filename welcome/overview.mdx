    title="Customer onboarding"

    Using OpenCopilot, Ready Player Me built a copilot that helps onboard new customers onto their developer platform. In addition to answering questions about the technical integration and making code snippets, the copilot helps the developer understand core concepts of the platform, licensing concerns, third-party integrations, and more. Click [here](TODO) to see the template and copilot in action.

  <Accordion
    title="Sales strategy and outreach"
    icon="handshake">
    In order to do more effective sales outreach, an executive built a copilot that helped not only write emails, but also be thoughtful about who and why to outreach to. The copilot helps with choosing a target group, identifying potential ways to reach out, and helps review personalized emails. Click [here](TODO) to grab the template and make it yours.

  <Accordion
    title="Domain expert"
    icon="chalkboard-user">
    There's a lot of explicit and implicit knowledge that makes up an expert's ability to answer questions. A copilot can do a lot of this -- and we built one to prove this. The LLM copilot helps engineers through the uncertainties of building an LLM-based application. Click [here](https://copilot.opencopilot.dev/) to see the LLM copilot live, or get the source code on [Github](https://github.com/opencopilotdev/opencopilot/tree/main/copilots/llm).
