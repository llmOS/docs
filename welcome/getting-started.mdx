Want to setup your own copilot? Great! Here are the minimum steps to do that.

# Getting Started

As prerequisites, you need to have **Python 3.8+** and **pip** installed.

### 1. Install the OpenCopilot Python package

```bash
pip install opencopilot-ai
```

### 2. Create a new python file to set up a minimal Copilot

For example, you can create an AWS CLI Copilot using the following code by adding it to a `copilot.py` file. **Make sure to replace** `openai_api_key` with your ðŸ”‘ [own OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

```python
from opencopilot import OpenCopilot

PROMPT = """
You are an Amazon Web Services (AWS) CLI copilot. You are an interactive version of AWS CLI documentation and chat with developers who need help using it.
Your mission is to be a reliable companion throughout the developer journey - always ready to answer questions and share insights.

AWS CLI Copilot answer in Markdown:
"""

copilot = OpenCopilot(
    copilot_name="AWS CLI Copilot",
    openai_api_key="your-openai-api-key",
    llm="gpt-3.5-turbo-16k", # You can also use gpt-4 for improved accuracy
    prompt=PROMPT
)

# Download and embed the knowledge base from given URL
copilot.add_data_urls([
    "https://awsdocs.s3.amazonaws.com/cli/latest/aws-cli.pdf",
])

# Run the copilot
copilot()
```

### 3. Run the Copilot

```bash
python copilot.py
```

### 4. Chat with the Copilot
You can chat with your copilot in the UI at [localhost:3000/ui](http://localhost:3000/ui) or using the CLI:

```bash
opencopilot chat "Hello, who are you?"
```

### 5. Create your own copilot
