Want to setup your own copilot? Great! Here are the minimum steps to do that.

As prerequisites, you need to have **Python 3.8+** and **pip** installed.

### 1. Install the OpenCopilot Python package

```bash
pip install opencopilot-ai
```

### 2. Create a new python file to set up a minimal Copilot
For example, `copilot.py`, where you add the code from below. Also, add your own `openai_api_key`, which you can get [from here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

If you have access to GPT-4, we recommend changing `llm_model_name` to `gpt-4`.

```python
from opencopilot import OpenCopilot

PROMPT = """
You are a Parrot Copilot. Your purpose is to repeat what the user says, but in a different wording.

=========
{context}
=========

{history}
User: {question}
Parrot Copilot answer in Markdown:
"""

copilot = OpenCopilot(
    openai_api_key="your-openai-api-key",
    llm_model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo-16k",
    prompt=PROMPT
    )

# Run the copilot
copilot()
```

### 3. Run the Copilot

```bash
python copilot.py
```

### 4. Chat with the Copilot
You can chat with your copilot in the UI at [localhost:3000/ui](http://localhost:3000/ui) or using the CLI:

```bash
opencopilot chat "Hello, who are you?"
```
See the [interactive Swagger docs](http://localhost:3000/docs#/Chat/handle_conversation_v0_conversation__conversation_id__post) for full API documentation.

### What next?

* **Create your own custom copilot**: [start here](/create/) by prompting, adding context, etc.
* Read more about the core features and stack choices of OpenCopilot in [Overview](/welcome/overview).


### Optional: front-end

<img height="200" src="/images/opencopilot_frontend.png" />

OpenCopilot by default helps you setup only a Python API service -- a backend -- for your copilot. That is intentional: we expect most people to integrate the functionality into their own application. However, if you want to setup a front-end for your copilot, we provide a working NextJS application out of the box. Follow the steps below to do so.

As a pre-requisite, you need to have [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) installed.

First, clone the [opencopilotdev/opencopilot-frontend](https://github.com/opencopilotdev/opencopilot-frontend) repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opencopilotdev/opencopilot-frontend
```

Then, setup the environment variables:

```bash
cd opencopilot-frontend
cp .env.example .env
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run the front-end application:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

You can now access the front-end at http://localhost:3001.
