Want to setup your own copilot? Great! Here are the minimum steps to do that.

### 1. Install the Python package

```bash
pip install opencopilot-ai
```

### 2. Create a minimal Copilot

Into a Python file (for example, `copilot.py`), add:


```python
from opencopilot import OpenCopilot

copilot = OpenCopilot()
copilot()
```

### 3. Run the Copilot

```bash
python copilot.py
```

That's it! The copilot is now running as an API service! ðŸŽ‰ You can now chat with it: TODO how? (CLI, frontend, etc)

OpenCopilot by default helps you setup a Python API service for your copilot. That is intentional: we expect most people to integrate the functionality into their own application. However, if you want to setup a front-end for your copilot, we provide a working NextJS application out of the box. Follow the steps below to do so.


### Front-end

As a pre-requisite, you need to have [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) installed.

First, clone the [opencopilotdev/opencopilot](https://github.com/opencopilotdev/opencopilot) repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:opencopilotdev/opencopilot.git
```

Then, setup the environment variables:

```bash
cd opencopilot/frontend
cp .env.example .env
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run the front-end application:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

You can now access the front-end at http://localhost:3001.
