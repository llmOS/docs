Want to setup your own copilot? Great! Here are the minimum steps to do that.

As a prerequisite, you need to have **Python 3.8+** and **pip** installed.

### 1. Install the Python package

```bash
pip install opencopilot-ai
```

### 2. Create a minimal Copilot

Into a Python file (for example, `copilot.py`), add:


```python
from opencopilot import OpenCopilot

copilot = OpenCopilot(
    openai_api_key="your-openai-api-key",
    llm_model_name="gpt-4",
    prompt_file="my_prompt.txt"
    )

# Run the copilot
copilot()
```

Make sure your custom prompt file exists: in `my_prompt.txt`, add the following:

```txt
Your are a Parrot Copilot.
Your purpose is to repeat what the user says, but in a different wording.
You can use the context and history to do so.

=========
{context}
=========

{history}
User: {question}
Parrot Copilot answer in Markdown:
```

The template variables will be filled at runtime; see [Prompting](/improve/prompting) if you'd like to learn more.

### 3. Run the Copilot

```bash
python copilot.py
```

That's it! The copilot is now running as an API service, at `localhost:3000` by default!

ðŸŽ‰ You can quickly test and chat with it by using commandline:

```bash
opencopilot chat "Hello, who are you?"
```

See the [interactive Swagger docs](http://localhost:3000/docs#/Chat/handle_conversation_v0_conversation__conversation_id__post) for full API documentation.

### Optional: front-end

<img height="200" src="/images/opencopilot_frontend.png" />

OpenCopilot by default helps you setup only a Python API service -- a backend -- for your copilot. That is intentional: we expect most people to integrate the functionality into their own application. However, if you want to setup a front-end for your copilot, we provide a working NextJS application out of the box. Follow the steps below to do so.

As a pre-requisite, you need to have [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) installed.

First, clone the [opencopilotdev/opencopilot-frontend](https://github.com/opencopilotdev/opencopilot-frontend) repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opencopilotdev/opencopilot-frontend
```

Then, setup the environment variables:

```bash
cd opencopilot-frontend
cp .env.example .env
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run the front-end application:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

You can now access the front-end at http://localhost:3001.
