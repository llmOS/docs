Here are the minimum steps to setup your own copilot

### 1. Install the Python package

```bash
pip install opencopilot-ai
```

### 2. Create a minimal Copilot

Into a Python file (for example, `copilot.py`), add:


```python
from opencopilot import OpenCopilot

copilot = OpenCopilot()
copilot()
```

### 3. Run the Copilot

```bash
python copilot.py
```

That's it! The copilot is now running! ðŸŽ‰ You can now chat with it: TODO how? (CLI, frontend, etc)
