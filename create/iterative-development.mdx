title: "Iterative development"
---

A copilot is only valuable if it is truly custom to your use case: it has access to the relevant
information and communicates with the users in the specific style you want. To get there and unlock it's
true value, the development has to be iterative. This is the best way to see your copilot improving.
Think of it like leveling up a Tamagotchi!

After you see [example use cases](/welcome/overview#use-cases) to get inspired, it is time to create and start leveling up your own custom copilot!
Kick it off from prompting:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Prompting"
    icon="i-cursor"
    href="/create/prompting"
  >
    Change the system prompt to give the copilot instructions, change its style, and much more.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Knowledge base"
    icon="books"
    href="/create/knowledge-base"
  >
    Add a knowledge base so your copilot can rely on it to provide more relevant answers.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Debugging"
    icon="bug"
    href="/create/debugging"
  >
  Use our debugging tools and recommendations to understand how to improve your copilot.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Evaluation"
    icon="ruler"
    href="/create/evaluation"
  >
  Set up automatic evaluation of your copilot's responses so you can tell whether it's getting better.
  </Card>

FYI if you're not sure for which use case to build a copilot, we provide plenty of examples in the following steps.
