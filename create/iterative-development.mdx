title: "Iterative development"
---

A copilot is only valuable if it's truly custom to your use case: it has access to the relevant
information and communicates with the users in the specific style you want. 
To get there and unlock it's true value, the development has to be iterative. 
**Iterative development means continuously editing the prompt and adding or removing data to knowledge base 
while using the debugging and evaluation methods** that come with OpenCopilot to clearly see your copilot improve.

It doesn't mean that developing a copilot happens exactly in this order and in concrete cycles, 
it is much more a way of thinking about building a copilot, sometimes editing the prompt
and having a quick chat with the copilot will do just fine to see the difference.

**From our experience, we recommend starting to build your custom copilot like this:**
1. Start with promting, it's the most impactful tool in the beginning
2. After a few first tries with prompting, add data to the knowledge base
3. Continuously chat with the copilot while putting a few cycles into the previous two - using CLI command or the chat UI
4. Bring in our debugging tools to make sure copilot is working as you'd expect
5. Automated evaluation could come in whenever you feel manual chatting takes too long to evaluate

For insipiration see [example use cases](/welcome/overview#use-cases) and kick off building your custom copilot with prompting:

  <Card

    href="/create/prompting"
  >
    Change the system prompt to give the copilot instructions, change its style, and much more.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Knowledge base"
    icon="books"
    href="/create/knowledge-base"
  >
    Add a knowledge base so your copilot can rely on it to provide more relevant answers.

  Use our debugging tools and recommendations to understand how to improve your copilot.

  Set up automatic evaluation of your copilot's responses so you can tell whether it's getting better.

FYI if you're not sure for which use case to build a copilot, we provide plenty of examples in the following steps.
