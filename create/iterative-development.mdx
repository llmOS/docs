title: "Iterative development"
---

A copilot is only valuable if it's truly custom to your use case: it has access to the relevant
information and communicates with the users in the specific style you want. 
To get there and unlock it's true value, the development has to be iterative. 

Iterative development means **1. building:** editing the prompt and the data in copilot's knowledge base, **2.
measuring:** using evaluation and debugging methods that come with OpenCopilot, and **3. 
learning:** based on evaluation results - did the copilot improve or not. Analogous to [lean loop](https://www.leaneast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lean-Startup-Thinking.jpg).

Developing a copilot doesn't always go exactly in this order, sometimes editing the prompt
and having a quick chat (manual evaluation) with the copilot will do just fine to see the difference.

**Based on our experience, best to start building your custom copilot like this:**
1. Start with _prompting_, it's the most impactful tool in the beginning
2. After a few first tries with prompting, add your custom data to the _knowledge base_
3. Continuously _evaluate_ the copilot manually by chatting with it - using CLI command or the chat UI
4. _Automated evaluation_ could come in whenever you feel manual chatting takes too long
5. Use our _debugging_ tools to get a deeper understanding of copilot internally (LLM, retrieval, etc.)

For insipiration see [example use cases](/welcome/overview#use-cases) and **kick off building your custom copilot with prompting:**

FYI if you're not sure for which use case to build a copilot, we provide plenty of examples in the following steps.
