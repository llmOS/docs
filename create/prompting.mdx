Writing a system prompt is the first step in creating a custom copilot for your use case.
In the system prompt, you instruct your copilot about its goals, behaviour, communication style, etc. 
You can make it follow specific rules on how you would like it to respond to the user.

Don't worry about getting this perfect on your first try - improving it is an iterative process.
Here's a simple example:

## 1. Write a system prompt:

```text
Your are a Parrot Copilot.
Your purpose is to repeat what the user says, but in a different wording.
You can use the context and history to do so.

=========
{context}
=========

{history}
User: {question}

To get you inspired, you can find some use cases [here](/welcome/overview#use-cases) and see example prompt files in our [examples folder](https://github.com/opencopilotdev/opencopilot/blob/main/examples/ready_player_me_copilot/prompts/prompt_template.txt).

### Prompt file structure

The prompt is not a static piece of text. It is a template that is dynamically **filled at runtime**.
This way the copilot is aware of information unique to the interaction, hence you should always place three template variables into the prompt file (ideally at the end),
and they will be substituted as follows:

* `{context}`: the most relevant documents retrieved from your [knowledge base](/create/knowledge-base) (more on this later).
* `{history}`: the conversation history between the user and the copilot.
* `{question}`: the most recent input from the user -- the message they just sent.

**Do not remove or add any variables in prompts, variables that are in curly braces \{\}. (For example: \{context\})**

## 2. Register it with the copilot:

If you followed Quickstart in our Readme, then you need to replace this with 

```python
copilot = OpenCopilot(
    prompt_file="my_prompt.txt",
    ... # other arguments
    )
```

Re-run the copilot with `python copilot.py` and it will now use the prompt from `my_prompt.txt` instead of the default.


### Writing a good system prompt

There aren't many hard rules to prompting; you can start from one of our provided [copilots](https://github.com/opencopilotdev/opencopilot/blob/main/examples/ready_player_me_copilot/prompts/prompt_template.txt) and iterate to improve the copilot's behaviour. Prompt engineering is a deep topic; for a more in-depth overview, see [OpenAI's list of prompting guides](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook#prompting-guides). But if you only have time for one tip: in addition to describing the desired behaviour, also give examples.
