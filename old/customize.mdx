title: "Customizing Your Copilot"

There are three main ways you can customize your copilot: _Knowledge base_ and _Prompts_ that change the copilot's behaviour, and _Front-end configuration_ that changes how it is presented. To see these in action, you can check out several examples in the `copilots/` directory -- to use one of the provided examples, just copy over the relevant files.

### Knowledge base

The [**knowledge base**] is the set of documents that your copilot relies on when responding to you - you can think of it as the things you've taught it. The copilot has access to everything here when trying to answer your questions. To add things into the knowledge base, just drop files into `copilots/<my-copilot>/data/` directory.

The following file formats are supported:

* `pdf` files
* `csv`, `tsv` and `xls`/`xlsx` (Excel) files
* `txt` files
* `json` files

Thus, to add new knowledge and your own data to the Copilot simply add your own files to `copilots/<my-copilot>/data` folder and run:

```bash
opencopilot restart
```

This will chunk the files, embed them and add them to the vector store so your Copilot can access it. **You need to restart the Copilot in order to ingest new data.**

### Testing

You can use Debug mode in the front-end which helps you test and iterate your Copilot.

### Evaluating

You can evaluate the performance of your copilot, by adding questions and expected answers to `copilots/<my-copilot>/eval_data/endtoend_human.json`,
and running:
```bash
opencopilot evaluate
```
To see an example of this, check the file in `copilots/rpm/eval_data/endtoend_human.json`.

This is especially helpful in trying to figure out if some data changes or prompt changes actually made the copilot better.
