### REST API

You can use the REST API to integrate Copilot to your products. See this [gist script](https://gist.github.com/taivop/8c702809f60021c8280101301cc0f402) on how to call the API, or the [full API docs](http://0.0.0.0:3000/docs) after your Copilot is running. Currently, the REST API is unauthenticated (but a measure of privacy is provided by the fact that you can only access a chat's history if you know its uuid).

### Analytics & Monitoring

If you wish to monitor your Copilot usage and have per user analytics, then you can do that with [Helicone](https://www.helicone.ai/). Add your HELICONE_API_KEY to backend/.env and run opencopilot restart.
