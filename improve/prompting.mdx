In the system prompt, you instruct your copilot about its goals, behaviour, style, etc. To use your own system prompt, you need to take two steps.

First, create a prompt file:

```text
Your are a Parrot Copilot.
Your purpose is to repeat what the user says, but in a different wording.
You can use the context and history to do so.

=========
{context}
=========

{history}
User: {question}
Parrot Copilot answer in Markdown:
```

Then, save it to a file, e.g. `my_prompt.txt`, and register it with the copilot:

```python
copilot = OpenCopilot(
    prompt_file="my_prompt.txt",
    ... # other arguments
    )
```

The entire `copilot.py` file would then look like this:

```python
from opencopilot import OpenCopilot

copilot = OpenCopilot(
    prompt_file="my_prompt.txt",
    openai_api_key="your-openai-api-key"
    )

copilot()
```

Re-run the copilot with `python copilot.py` and it will now use the prompt from `my_prompt.txt` instead of the default.

### Prompt file structure

The prompt is not a static piece of text. It is a template that will be filled at runtime, after the user has messaged the copilot but before sending the request to the LLM. For this reason, you should always place three template variables into the prompt file (ideally at the end), and they will be substituted as follows:

* `{context}`: the most relevant documents retrieved from your [knowledge base](/improve/knowledge-base).
* `{history}`: the conversation history between the user and the copilot.
* `{question}`: the most recent input from the user -- the message they just sent.

**Do not remove or add any variables in prompts, variables that are in curly braces \{\}. (For example: \{context\})**

### Writing a good system prompt

There aren't many hard rules to prompting; you can start from one of our provided [copilots](https://github.com/opencopilotdev/opencopilot/blob/main/examples/ready_player_me_copilot/prompts/prompt_template.txt) and iterate to improve the copilot's behaviour. Prompt engineering is a deep topic; for a more in-depth overview, see [OpenAI's list of prompting guides](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook#prompting-guides). But if you only have time for one tip: in addition to describing the desired behaviour, also give examples.
