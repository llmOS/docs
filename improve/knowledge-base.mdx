title: "Knowledge base"
---

The **knowledge base** is the set of documents that your copilot relies on when responding - you can think of it as the things you've taught it. The copilot has access to everything here when trying to answer your questions.

### Prerequisites

TODO - need to have weaviate running / enabled / integrated

### Adding files and folders to the knowledge base

To add things into the knowledge base, TODO code example.

The following file formats are supported by default:

* `pdf` files
* `csv`, `tsv` and `xls`/`xlsx` (Excel) files
* `txt` files
* `json` files

### Adding a custom document loader

In some situations, our default file loaders may not be sufficient. For example:

* You have a custom file format that you want to load into the knowledge base.
* Your files are large and you want to have control over how they are chunked.
* Instead of the local filesystem, you want to load files from a remote location like Amazon S3, a URL, a database, etc.

In these situations, you can write a custom document loader. A document loader is simply a function that returns a list of documents.

For example, here's a minimal document loader that loads a single document from a URL:

```python

TODO

```
