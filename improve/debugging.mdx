title: "Debugging"
---

You almost never get your copilot right on the first try, so you'll need to debug why you aren't getting the responses you'd like.

There can be many reasons, but the most common is that the LLM does not see the relevant document from the [knowledge base](/improve/knowledge-base), and so does not have enough context to produce a good response. This usually happens because the document is indexed in the knowledge base, but the copilot does not retrieve it -- most likely because the user query wasn't a close enough match to the document in the embedding space.

To debug this and other issues, you can use the debug view.

First, you need to enable the debug view by running the [front-end application](/welcome/getting-started#optional-front-end) with the right flag. In the front-end directory, edit the `.env` file to set the following flag:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_ENABLED="true"
```

Then, restart the front-end application.

There are two ways to open the debug view once enabled:

1. "Debug" button in the top right corner of the screen will open or close the debugging sidebar.
2. A bug icon next to a copilot response will take you to the debug view of that message.

<img src="/improve/debugging_images/how_to_open_debug_view.png" />

This is what the debug view looks like:

<img src="/improve/debugging_images/debug_view_open.png" />

The debug view will show you the following information:

1. The full prompt template used.
2. The user question.
3. Retrieved documents that were inserted into the prompt template.
4. Chat history.
5. Full prompt that was sent to the LLM.
6. The LLM response.

You can click to open any section. Wherever applicable, you'll also see the token count for that section.

For example, here's a debug view of the prompt template:
<img src="/improve/debugging_images/debug_view_prompt_template.png" />

...and here's a debug view of the retrieved documents:
<img src="/improve/debugging_images/debug_view_retrieved_docs.png" />

We recommend keeping the debug view enabled while you're developing your copilot. It will help you understand what's going on under the hood, and tell you whether you should be improving the [prompt](/improve/prompting), adding documents to the [knowledge base](/improve/knowledge-base), or anything else.
