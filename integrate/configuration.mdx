There are many things you can optionally configure in OpenCopilot:

* which LLM to use (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, an open-source LLM, etc)
* API keys
* logging paths
* database URLs (for [Knowledge base](improve/knowledge-base.md))
* authentication

...and much more!

To see the full up-to-date list, see the `OpenCopilot` class initializer and method implementations on the [OpenCopilot Github](https://github.com/opencopilotdev/opencopilot/blob/main/opencopilot/application.py).
