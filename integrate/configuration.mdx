There are many things you can optionally configure in OpenCopilot. To change those, pass in the relevant argument to the `OpenCopilot()` initializer.


* `prompt_file` or `prompt`: The system prompt. The `prompt_file` argument can be used for a path; the `prompt` argument for passing in a string.
* `openai_api_key`: OpenAI API key. Used for making LLM and embedding calls.
* `helicone_api_key`: [Helicone](https://www.helicone.ai/) API key. Used for [Monitoring](/integrate/monitoring).  
* `llm`: Which LLM to use. Defaults to `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k`; currently the only alternative is `gpt-4`.
* `log_file_path`: Path to the log file.
* `weaviate_url`: URL of an already-running Weaviate instance to use for the [Knowledge base](/create/knowledge-base).
* `jwt_client_id` and `jwt_client_secret`: If you'd like to enable JWT authentication, you can pass in the client ID and secret here.
* `api_base_url` and `api_port`: what URL and port your copilot should be available at. Defaults to `127.0.0.1:3000`
