title: 'Configuration'

There are many things you can optionally configure in OpenCopilot. To change those, pass in the relevant argument to the `OpenCopilot()` initializer.

* `openai_api_key`: OpenAI API key. Used for making LLM and embedding calls.

* `helicone_api_key`: [Helicone](https://www.helicone.ai/) API key. Used for [Monitoring](/integrate/monitoring).  
* `llm_model_name`: Which LLM to use. Defaults to `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k`.
* `log_file_path`: Path to the log file.
* `weaviate_url`: URL of the Weaviate instance to use for the [Knowledge base](improve/knowledge-base.md).
* `jwt_client_id` and `jwt_client_secret`: If you'd like to enable JWT authentication, you can pass in the client ID and secret here.
