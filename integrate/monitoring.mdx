If you wish to monitor your Copilot usage and have per user analytics, then you can do that with [Helicone](https://www.helicone.ai/).

To do so, you need to:

1. [Sign up](https://www.helicone.ai/signup) for Helicone and get an API key. (Alternatively, you can [self-host](https://docs.helicone.ai/getting-started/open-source) Helicone.)

1. Add the key into the settings - setting the `helicone_api_key` variable. (/integrate/settings)
