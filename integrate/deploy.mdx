Deploying your copilot is similar to deploying any Python application. There are many options, from deploying to a bare metal server, to using a container orchestration service, etc.

We have provided an example docker setup to deploy the whole stack.

### Setup

Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/opencopilotdev/opencopilot.git
cd examples/production
```

Run the whole stack:

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY="FILL_IN"
docker-compose up --build
```

### Explanation

* Copilot is packaged in Docker container. See more in `docker/copilot`
* Nginx is in front of the python Rest API. See more in `docker/nginx`
* Weaviate vector store is running in separate docker container to support storing data
* Frontend is running in separate docker container
