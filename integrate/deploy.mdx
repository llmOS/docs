Deploying your copilot is similar to deploying any Python application. There are many options, from deploying to a bare metal server, to using a container orchestration service, etc.


## Replit

[Replit](https://replit.com/) is an IDE, a code collaboration platform, a cloud provider and more.

### Setup

- Fork the [project](https://replit.com/@OpenCopilot/OpenCopilot) on Replit
- Add your OpenAI API key to secrets with the key "OPENAI_API_KEY"

- Modify the code however you wish by adding data etc
- Click Run

### Suggestions

- To have the project running 24/7 you will need a paid account and enable "Always On" from the top left menu

## Docker

We have provided an example docker setup to deploy the whole stack.

### Setup

Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/opencopilotdev/opencopilot.git
cd examples/docker_deployment
```

Run the whole stack:

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY="FILL_IN"
docker-compose up --build
```

### Explanation

<img src="/images/docker_stack.png" />

* docker-compose.yml defines all the containers and their connections. See more in `docker_deployment/docker-compose.yml`.
* Copilot is packaged in Docker container. See more in `docker/copilot`
* Frontend is running inside the Copilot Docker container on path `/ui`.
* Nginx is in front of the python Rest API and the frontend. See more in `docker/nginx`
* Weaviate vector store is running in separate docker container to support storing data.

### Suggestions

* You can run frontend separately as well. The open-source repository is [here](https://github.com/opencopilotdev/frontend-library). Or you can just run in a simple HTML by embedding the chat, example [here](https://github.com/opencopilotdev/frontend-library/blob/master/embed.html)
* You can run nginx on different ports For example to run nginx on port 5000 change in docker-compose:

```yaml
  nginx:
    ports:
      - "5000:80"
```
