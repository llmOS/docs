title: 'Deployment'

Deploying your copilot is similar to deploying any Python application. There are many options, from deploying to a bare metal server, to using a container orchestration service, etc.

We have provided an example docker setup to deploy the whole stack.

### Setup

Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/opencopilotdev/opencopilot.git
cd examples/docker_deployment
```

Run the whole stack:

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY="FILL_IN"
docker-compose up --build
```

### Explanation

<img src="/images/docker_stack.png" />

* docker-compose.yml defines all the containers and their connections. See more in `docker_deployment/docker-compose.yml`
* Copilot is packaged in Docker container. See more in `docker/copilot`
* Nginx is in front of the python Rest API. See more in `docker/nginx`
* Weaviate vector store is running in separate docker container to support storing data
* Frontend is running in separate docker container

### Suggestions

* You can run frontend in a separate machine. Just extract the frontend part from docker-compose
* You can run nginx or frontend on different ports. For example to run nginx on port 5000 change in docker-compose:

```yaml
    ports:
      - "5000:80"
```
