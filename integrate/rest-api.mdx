title: 'REST API'
---

The largest value of the copilot comes from integrating it tightly into your own application. To do so, OpenCopilot provides a REST API.

To use the REST API, you need to have a copilot running. See the [Getting Started](/welcome/getting-started) guide for instructions on how to run a copilot.

Once the copilot is running, you can see live Swagger documentation of the API at [0.0.0.0:3000/docs](http://0.0.0.0:3000/docs) (if you're running the copilot on a different port, replace `3000` with the port you're running it on).

## Router

OpenCopilot also exposes a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) router object, for expanding the API however you need.

```
from opencopilot import OpenCopilot

copilot = OpenCopilot(
    prompt_file="my_prompt.txt",
)


# @copilot.router is the router that is exposed
@copilot.router.get(
    "/my-endpoint",
)
async def my_endpoint():
    return {"key": "value"}

copilot()
```

For more information about how to define endpoints and what's supported, check out the [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) docs.
