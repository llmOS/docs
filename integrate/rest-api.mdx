title: 'REST API'
---

The largest value of the copilot comes from integrating it tightly into your own application. To do so, OpenCopilot provides a REST API.

To use the REST API, you need to have a copilot running. See the [Getting Started](/getting-started) guide for instructions on how to run a copilot.

Once the copilot is running, you can see live Swagger documentation of the API at [0.0.0.0:3000/docs](http://0.0.0.0:3000/docs) (if you're running the copilot on a different port, replace `3000` with the port you're running it on).
